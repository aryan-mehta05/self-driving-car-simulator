# Self Driving Car Simulator
A Self-Driving Car Simulator that uses the Genetic Algorithm at its core to generate the functionality. This algorithm forms a basis for the Neural Network on which the outputs of the car's movement depend totally on. The code is entirely written in JavaScript and visualized using a simple HTML/CSS stack.
